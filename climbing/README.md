# Climbing route grading classifier

The [moonboard](https://www.moonboard.com) is a climbing training tool.  Each moonboard is a short identical climbing wall with the same holds, at the same orinentation in the same place.  There is a database of approximately 12,000 climbs held on the moonboard website to be used with a mobile app.  Each entry in the database describes which holds to use for the climb, gives it a difficult rating (grade) by given by the route setter and a crowd sourced grade given by the community, who have climbed the route.

Our aim is to predict the climbing grade only given the holds used for a climb.  This is a hard task - one which experienced climbers would find hard to do without climbing the route.  Even after climbing a route the route setter grade and the crowd source grade only agreed 95% of the time.

Tasks and layout of the code:
- We scraped the data from the moonboard website in the [scraper notebook](Scraper.ipynb).
- We clean the data and analyise it in the [Data-cleaning-and-analysis notebook](Data-cleaning-and-analysis.ipynb).
- We fit a CNN (convolution neural network) model based upon ResNetv2 in the [CNN notebook](CNN.ipynb). 

Result: we achieved 62% accuracy on the test dataset.
